#### Overview
Across the globe, there have been many reports of UFO sightings, which some believe could be extra-terrestrials visiting Earth from other worlds. The purpose of the UFO Finder web page is to allow users to filter the available data of UFO sightings and display a table of the filtered data. This makes it easy for the user to find specific sightings in the data, possibly to see how many and what kind of UFOs have been spotted a local area.

#### Results
The UFO Finder successfully filters and displays the data based on the arguments the user passes to the input fields. The results are displayed once the user clicks anywhere on the page after entering the filter criteria. By default, the sightings are sorted by date.
